This project includes the implementation of a binary search tree
This implementation of a binary search tree has functions that can destroy and copy the tree. 
Insertion runs recursively and deletion uses process left most in order to make the binary tree after the process. 
Traversal algorithm is inorder. 
In addition to the common binary search tree methods, this implementation includes some additional methods: 


The method "containsSequence" detects whether the required sequence is in the tree or not. 
The method "countNodesDeeperThan" finds the number of nodes which are deeper than a given number. 
The method "maxBalancedHeight" determine the maximum height of the given binary search tree if it would be balanced. 
However, this method will not give the correct result after a second call because of a minor error.
